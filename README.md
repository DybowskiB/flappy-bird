# 🐤 Flappy Bird – Networked Version with Touch Sensor Support

This project is a custom implementation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game with a twist — it supports both **keyboard** and **Raspberry Pi touch sensor** input, and runs in a **client-server architecture**.

## 🎮 Overview

- The game consists of a **server** that maintains game logic and state, and a **client** that renders the game UI.
- Players can control the bird using:
  - `Space` or `Tab` keys (on desktop)
  - A **touch sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi** (via GPIO)

This setup allows for remote or embedded physical interaction with the game in real time.
